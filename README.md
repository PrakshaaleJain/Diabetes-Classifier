# Diabetes Classifier

This project is a machine learning model designed to classify diabetes based on medical data. It uses a shallow Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with 2â€“3 layers for classification. MLP approach is taken rather thna logistic regression because it capture non-linear relations in the dataset and is more flexible than logistic regression.

## Features
- Uses a neural network for diabetes prediction
- Implements a shallow MLP for classification
- Supports dataset preprocessing and feature scaling

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Diabetes_Classifier.git
   cd Diabetes_Classifier
   ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:

```sh
jupyter notebook Diabetes_Classifier.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
```sh
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
tensorflow/keras
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter
```

## Dataset
The model is trained on a diabetes dataset. Ensure you have the dataset in the appropriate directory before running the notebook. If required, update the dataset path inside the notebook.
